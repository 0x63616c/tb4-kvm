# Project status

## Phase

Pre-PCB design review.

## Locked decisions

- Thunderbolt 4, not Thunderbolt 5, for v1.
- Two upstream computers, one selected at a time.
- One physical button; no software required on the locked-down work computer.
- A small always-on controller and optional local display.
- Open source documentation, firmware, PCB and mechanical interface wherever vendor licensing permits.
- No PCB layout before the research package is reviewed.

## Recommended but not yet approved

- One TB4 accessory router with selectable upstream front end.
- One downstream TB4 port connected to the existing dock.
- Selected host receives up to 60 W; unselected host is electrically detached and unpowered.
- Separate low-speed display/button daughterboard to keep its wiring away from TB4 traces.
- One signal/control proof followed by one integrated board and one correction revision.

## Open gates

- Intel reference design, controller firmware/NVM and certification path.
- Exact power-supply budget and whether 60 W selected-host charging is sufficient.
- Exact downstream behavior with the existing OWC dock and target display.
- S-parameter channel simulation and fabricator stack-up.
- Final connector, ESD, mux and PD-controller companion parts.
- Patent/legal review before any commercial sale, especially for dual-controller resource-switching alternatives.

The authoritative close criteria for these gates are tracked in [Design-readiness checklist](docs/DESIGN-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md). Signal responsibilities are fixed at the pre-schematic level in [Signal and power ownership](docs/SIGNAL-POWER-OWNERSHIP.md). Mechanical work is limited to the interface rules in [Mechanical interface guidance](docs/MECHANICAL-INTERFACE.md) until a measured integrated board exists.

## Reported baseline requiring recapture

On 2026-09-01, `system_profiler SPThunderboltDataType` was reported to show the connected OWC Thunderbolt Dock 96W in USB4 mode at 40 Gb/s. The raw sanitized command capture, exact host/cable context and immutable evidence record were not retained in this repository, so the ledger deliberately downgrades this to `PROPOSED`. Re-run the documented baseline capture before using it as measured evidence. Even after recapture it will be a functional baseline, not electrical compliance.
